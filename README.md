## GitHub Actions x AWS CodePipeline

This GitHub Actions will help you trigger a pipeline in your AWS CodePipeline - assumming you already have the pipeline. This will not create the pipeline for you.

This is mainly copied from project [GitHub Actions x AWS CodePipeline](https://github.com/zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action) by [Zulhilmi Zainudin](https://github.com/zulhfreelancer) and I thank him for his work on it.

One of the issues I found with this action was that if something went wrong when triggering the pipeline it would print the error but it would mark the action as failed.
That is what I have tried to address with my changes to his code with everything else being the same.

## Code in Main

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

<!-- Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:  
```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
``` -->

## Setup

### AWS IAM

Create an IAM user with `codepipeline:StartPipelineExecution` permission. You may take and customize the IAM policy below as starter point. Note that I'm using `"*"` in the policy. For better security, you can limit the policy to only execute specific pipelines. You can read more about IAM for CodePipeline [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/permissions-reference.html).

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "codepipeline:StartPipelineExecution"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### GitHub Secrets

After you create the IAM user with the right permission, add two variables below in your GitHub repository secrets area:

- `AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY`: the Access Key ID for the user that you just created
- `AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY`: the Secret Key for the user that you just created

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Note**:

- Please check the latest available version [here](#) and replace it with `X.X.X` in the code examples below.

- Identify in which AWS region your pipeline is located. Use that region name for `aws-region` key below. AWS regions list is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints).

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Trigger AWS CodePipeline
        uses: zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action@vX.X.X
        with:
          aws-region: "ap-southeast-1"
          aws-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY }}
          pipeline-name: "your-pipeline-name"
```

### Advance Usage

Below is the example for situation where:

- You only want to trigger the pipeline if previous job was successful
- You only want to trigger the pipeline if the Git branch that GitHub Actions currently running is a specific branch

```
jobs:
  job1:
    ... code for job1 ...
  deploy:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Trigger AWS CodePipeline
        uses: zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action@vX.X.X
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/your-branch-name'
        with:
          aws-region: "ap-southeast-1"
          aws-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY }}
          pipeline-name: "your-pipeline-name"
```

Add tests if deemed reasonable
